## Deadfall

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 173_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**Associated Terrain** any forests, jungles, mountains, or swaps  
**Type** mechanical; **Perception** DC 20; **Disable Device** DC 20

### Effects

**Trigger** location; **Reset** manual  
**Effect** Rigged to boulders, logs, or other heavy weights in canopies or on ledges, a trip line strung across an area can create a deadly trap. When a creature enters the deadfall’s trigger square, the weights drop in a 20-foot line or a 10-foot-square area, affecting four 5-foot squares in all. Each creature in this area takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. With a successful DC 20 Reflex save, a target takes half the damage and avoids being knocked prone.
