## Swinging Log

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 172_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**Associated Terrain** any forests or jungles  
**Type** mechanical; **Perception** DC 12; **Disable Device** DC 12

### Effects

**Trigger** location; **Reset** manual  
**Effect** A large, heavy log is suspended in the canopy of a forest or jungle and attached to a trip line. When a creature passes through a 5-foot-square that’s been trapped by this trip line, the log swings down and makes a melee attack with a +5 bonus (1d6+5 points of bludgeoning damage). A creature damaged by this log must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid being knocked prone. Affixing a number of sharpened sticks to the log adds an additional 2d6 points of piercing damage and increases its CR by 1.
