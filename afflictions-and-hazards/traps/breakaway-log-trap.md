## Breakaway Log

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 173_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**Associated Terrain** any forests, jungles, or swamps  
**Type** mechanical; **Perception** DC 25; **Disable Device** DC 30

### Effects

**Trigger** location; **Reset** repair  
**Effect** Fallen trees often form excellent natural bridges over rivers or chasms, or they afford routes to climb more safely over a wall or other barrier. Breakaway logs have been sabotaged so that they collapse once they are used. At the end of a round when a Medium or larger (or two Small) creatures use the log, it collapses. All creatures on the log then fall, taking appropriate damage from the plunge. This example breakaway log fills an area that is 5 feet wide and 20 feet long, and it results in a 20-foot fall which deals 2d6 points of falling damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save can cling to the log or leap to safety and avoid the damage entirely.
