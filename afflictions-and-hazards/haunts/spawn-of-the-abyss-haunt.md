# Spawn of the Abyss

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 172_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 11; **XP** 12,800  
CE persistent vaporous variant haunt (40-ft. radius)  
**Aura** strong conjuration  
**Caster Level** 13th  
**Notice** Perception or Knowledge (arcana) DC 25 (to notice a faint shimmering or recognize the significance of the fractured circle)  
**hp** 49; **Weakness** good and lawful effects (immune to positive energy); **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1d20 days  
**Effect** When a mortal creature enters the area, it’s presence provokes curiosity from the other side. The instability begins spewing a demon each round, and continues doing so for 1 minute. Use the following chart to determine what demon appears. These demons are not summoned.  
  

| **d4** | **Demon** |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1 | Dretch (CR 2) |
| 2 | Babau (CR 6) |
| 3 | Succubus (CR 7) |
| 4 | Nabasu (CR 8) |
  
**Benefit** A character can channel the instability’s power by spending 1 minute in the area while performing a ritual to focus its energy, requiring a DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (planes) check. If she succeeds, she gains the fiendish template for 24 hours, and her alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. If she fails, she is pulled into the Abyss.  
**Destruction** The instability can only be permanently closed with a _miracle_ or _wish_ spell. A _hallow_ spell tied to a dimensional anchor can temporarily prevent the instability’s effects.  

### Description

Dimensional instabilities are areas where the boundary between the Material Plane and another plane is thin and rifts between the planes frequently open. They take damage from effects that oppose the connected plane’s fundamental nature. For example, a dimensional instability associated with the chaotic evil Abyss takes damage from good or lawful spells or effects, and an instability tied to the Elemental Plane of Fire takes damage from water and cold effects. Instabilities can even provide benefits to those who know how to cultivate them.  
  
The sample haunt appeared when an ancient wizard bound 666 demons. Over time, the boundary between the Abyss and his summoning chamber grew thin, and the plane’s influence fractured the binding circle he carved into the floor, creating tiny rifts that flicker into existence at irregular intervals.  
  
In addition to good and lawful effects, the haunt is vulnerable to other damage associated with good or law at the GM’s discretion, such as the extra damage from a _holy_ weapon.
