# Crushing Terror

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 179_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 14; **XP** 38,400  
NE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 13th  
**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to hear the sound of bones snapping)  
**hp** 58; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 hour  
**Effect** Several copies of the same colossal dragon’s tail snake through the haunt’s area. Each round, the tails attempt to grab and constrict each creature in the area (+18 to hit, 2d6+6 points of damage plus grab, CMB +35, constrict 2d6+18 points of damage). Each round a creature takes damage from the tail’s constrict ability, one of its limbs (randomly determined) snaps into pieces, and it must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Cure spells are not sufficient to repair the severely broken bones this haunt produces—only [[heal|heal]] or stronger magic can mend them. Snapped limbs cannot be used for any purpose; having a snapped leg reduces a creature’s movement speed by half when using its legs, and having more than half a creature’s legs snapped prevents it from using any form of movement that uses its legs.  
**Destruction** The crushing terror haunt is destroyed if the bodies of the linnorm’s victims are retrieved from the cave where it stores them, reassembled, and buried.  

### Description

Tales of a legendary linnorm have drawn many daring adventurers who wish to prove themselves by slaying the dragon. The linnorm, for its part, appreciates the sport of hunting those who seek it, and is particularly fond of crushing its victims to death with its powerful tail. The spirits of these unfortunates linger on in the form of a crushing terror haunt.
