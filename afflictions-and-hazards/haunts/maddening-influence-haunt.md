# Maddening Influence

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 173_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 10; **XP** 9,600  
CE free-roaming persistent variant haunt (30-ft. radiu)  
**Caster Level** 9th  
**Notice** Perception DC 25 (to hear whispers emerging from inside the skulls of all nearby creatures  
**hp** 45; **Weakness** harmed by Knowledge (arcana, planes, or religion) DC 25 (immune to positive energy); **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** The whispers drift toward sentient beings, particularly those whose minds they have touched before. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage, or 1 Wisdom damage on a successful save (or if you are using the sanity system, 1d6 points of sanity damage on a successful save or 2d8 points on a failed save; see page 12). The DC increases by 1 for each round a creature spends within the haunt’s area (these rounds need not be consecutive, though a given creature’s DC resets to 16 after 24 hours and whenever the haunt is dispersed). Each time a creature damages this haunt, it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to its Knowledge check result or take 1d4 Wisdom drain (or, if you are using the sanity system, 1d8 points of sanity damage on a successful save or 2d10 points on a failed save).  
**Destruction** The haunt is destroyed if the corpses of all the cultists who created it are cremated and buried on consecrated ground.  

### Description

These haunts are tied to the reality-warping influence of beings beyond comprehension. The only way to hold these haunts at bay is to draw upon dark knowledge, but such knowledge comes at a cost. As a full-round action, any character within the haunt’s area can attempt an appropriate Knowledge check to perform a short rite, utter an arcane word, or otherwise quell the maddening influence (DC = 15 + the haunt’s CR). If successful, the haunt takes 5 points of damage plus additional damage equal to the amount the character exceeded the DC.  
  
The whispers from beyond haunt detailed below is an example of a maddening influence formed at the site of a mass ritual suicide. The murmurs worm their way into the minds of all who hear them and leave lasting wounds.
