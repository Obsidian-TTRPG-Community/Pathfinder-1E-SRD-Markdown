# Final Soldier

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 179_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 15; **XP** 51,200  
NE belligerent chained fast persistent tenacious vaporous haunt (60-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 15th  
**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to hear the muted sounds of battle)  
**hp** 202; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** A horde of armor-clad spectral soldiers rises from all sides. On the haunt’s initiative count, five soldiers beset each creature in the area, and each soldier makes a single incorporeal touch attack with a spectral sword (+12 to hit, 2d6+9 points of damage/19–20). Creatures in the haunt’s area can attack the soldiers, but even if they destroy an individual soldier, five soldiers continue to attack each of the creatures each round until they disperse the haunt.  
**Destruction** The final soldier will rest only once the ancient general, who has risen as a [[graveknight|graveknight]] antipaladin, is permanently destroyed.  

### Description

The ancient antipaladin general responsible for this haunt ruled through fear, and forbade his soldiers from accepting surrender or showing mercy. His favorite way to end a battle was to order his soldiers to kill everyone but the opposing army’s commander, then offer a rich reward to whichever of his soldiers could produce the opposing commander’s head.
