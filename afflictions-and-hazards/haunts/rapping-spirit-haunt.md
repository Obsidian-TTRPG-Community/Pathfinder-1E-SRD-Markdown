**CR** 1; **XP** 400  
Alignment varies persistent haunt (5-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 1st  
**Notice** Perception DC 10 (to hear faint knocking on the walls, floor, and furniture  
**hp** 4; **Weakness** tricked by [[hide-from-undead|hide from undead]]; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** A chorus of agitated raps and blows rings out from nearby hard surfaces (limited to those capable of being physically manipulated by [[mage-hand|mage hand]]) as unquiet spirits convey their unrest to the living. All who hear the supernatural knocks are affected by a [[cause-fear|cause fear]] effect (Will DC 11 negates).  
**Destruction** Depending on its alignment, a rapping spirit typically asks for its mortal remains to be laid to rest or for the PCs to seek revenge for its death. Fulfilling the request dismisses the haunt.  

### Description

The most common haunts are rapping spirits: unquiet dead with just enough substance to produce disembodied knocking and bumps in the night. Characters can attempt communication with these intelligent spirits by working out codes the spirits can use to convey cryptic messages, or by using tools like spirit planchettes to increase the efficiency of communication with the spirit.
