CE chained free-roaming persistent haunt (one ship, up to a 40-ft. radius)

**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to hear bubbles rising to the surface of the water)  
**hp** 36; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** A ghostly tendril of water erupts from the sea and forces itself into the lungs of a living creature aboard the ship, which then begins to drown.

**Destruction** The watery grave haunt is destroyed if the ghost ship’s captain is permanently destroyed.  

### Description

Watery grave haunts typically travel aboard ghost ships, protecting the ghost vessel’s passengers. When the ghost ship’s captain boards an enemy vessel, the watery grave haunt drifts aboard as well.
