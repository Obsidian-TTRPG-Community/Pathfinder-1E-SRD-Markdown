# Dimensional Tear

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 133_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**CR** 8; **XP** 4,800  
N persistent variant haunt (30-ft. radius)  
**Aura** moderate conjuration (calling)  
**Caster Level** 13th  
**Notice** Perception DC 18 (to see rippling, rainbow-hued distortions in the air)  
**hp** 27; **Weakness** negative energy (see [[echoes-of-the-first-world|echoes of the first world]]); **Trigger** proximity  
**Effect** As soon as a Small or larger creature enters the area of a dimensional tear, it is affected as if by [[plane-shift|plane shift]] and must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or be immediately transported to the First World. When this occurs, a creature from the First World (determined randomly from the [[summon-natures-ally-6|summon nature’s ally VI]] list) is teleported to a space adjacent to the echo, determined by the GM. The creature has a starting attitude of hostile.  
**Benefit** Determine the First World creature called using the [[summon-natures-ally-7|summon nature’s ally VII]] list instead, and then add the [[fey-giant-toad|fey creature template]].  
**Destruction** A character with [[plane-shift|plane shift]] prepared can attempt to counterspell the echo’s effect. Successfully doing so destroys the dimensional tear.
