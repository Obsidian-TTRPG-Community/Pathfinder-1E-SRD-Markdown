### Description

The regret of those who arrived too late to spare others a terrible fate can manifest as a haunt. A belated arrival haunt often arises near another haunt or undead, representing the fate that these regretful spirits were not fast enough to stop. A belated arrival haunt is often chained to a [[ghost|ghost]] but a [[necrocraft|necrocraft]] is a truly horrifying alternative.
