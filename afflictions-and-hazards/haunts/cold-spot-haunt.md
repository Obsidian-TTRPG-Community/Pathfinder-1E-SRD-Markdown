# Cold Spot

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 175_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 1; **XP** 400  
NE haunt (5-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 1st  
**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to feel the temperature dropping)  
**hp** 2; **Weakness** fire (these effects can damage the haunt); **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** The temperature suddenly plummets below freezing. All creatures within the radius are affected as if they had been outside in cold weather for 1 hour, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage unless they succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save. The cold temperature lingers for 10 minutes, but has no additional mechanical effect.  
**Destruction** If the cold spot is destroyed with holy fire (such as with [[flame-strike|flame strike]]), it never returns.  

### Description

Cold spots are echoes of spirits too weak to manifest as ghosts. They can occur alone or cluster around significant areas.
