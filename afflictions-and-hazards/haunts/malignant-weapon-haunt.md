# Malignant Weapon

**Source** [_Occult Adventures pg. 231_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures)  
**CR** 7; **XP** 3,200  
LE persistent item-bound haunt (haunted object affecting up to a 35-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 7th  
**Notice** Perception DC 25 (to hear distant cackling when touching the weapon)  
**hp** 36; **Weakness** tricked by [[invisibility|invisibility]]; **Trigger** special (see below); **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** Whenever the wielder of the haunted weapon threatens a critical hit with the weapon, the area immediately resonates with a cacophonous cackling. All creatures within a 35-foot radius centered on the weapon suffer the effects of a [[song-of-discord|song of discord]] spell (Will DC 17 negates) for the next 8 rounds. If the weapon’s wielder is affected, she gains a +2 bonus on the critical confirmation roll.  
**Destruction** The weapon must be boiled in the cauldron of a willing hag’s coven, which destroys both the weapon and the cauldron at the same time.  

### Description

Sometimes a weapon that slays a powerful witch or hag becomes tainted by the victim’s malignant hatred. Although haunted weapons often still bear holy marks from the original owners or relics like bones from a revered saint, these are never sufficient to contain the malevolence that dwells within the weapon.
