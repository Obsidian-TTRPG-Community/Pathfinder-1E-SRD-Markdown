**CR** 2; **XP** 600  
NE haunt (10-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 3rd  
**Notice** Perception DC 10 (to hear the moaning spirits approaching)  
**hp** 4; **Weakness** Intimidate; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 hour  
**Effect** Spectral forms of disembodied heads emerge from the floor and scream at everyone in the area, their jaws distending to an impossible width. Creatures are affected by [[scare|scare]]. The spectral heads take pride in terrorizing their victims; if a creature succeeds at a DC 16 Intimidate check to demonstrate its own frightening nature, the spirits decide the PC is the true winner of the current contest, after which they lose interest in the PCs for 1 hour as if reduced to 0 hit points.  
**Destruction** The spectral screams haunt is destroyed if a creature spends 8 consecutive hours sleeping in its area.  

### Description

Some spirits take joy in terrifying the living. Spectral screams are collections of lesser spirits who have banded together to increase the amount of terror they can spread.
