# Buried Alive

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 175_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 4; **XP** 1,200  
NE persistent haunt (15-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 5th  
**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to hear a shovel cleaving through dirt)  
**hp** 18; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** On the first round, spectral gravediggers create a single 15-foot-deep pit covering the haunt’s entire radius. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall to the bottom of the pit, taking 2d6 points of damage. Creatures who succeed leap to a square at the edge of the pit. The walls of the pit are uneven (Climb DC 20). On the second round, the spectral gravediggers fill the pit with loose, spectral dirt, burying everyone still inside. Buried creatures are pinned, but they can reduce their condition to grappled with a successful DC 15 Strength check. They take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute, and begin to suffocate after 10 minutes. Creatures outside of the pit can dig out the buried creatures. Each 5-foot cube of spectral dirt weighs 1,000 pounds; a creature can move 5 times her maximum load worth of dirt per minute, or 10 times her maximum load if she has a shovel. If the haunt is dispersed, buried creatures automatically rise to the surface.  
**Destruction** The haunt can be permanently destroyed if a character finds the bones of the person who was buried alive, exhumes them, coats them in holy water, and reburies them in a temple of their patron deity.  

### Description

The spirits of those unfortunate souls who are buried alive sometimes clamber to force others to share their fate.
