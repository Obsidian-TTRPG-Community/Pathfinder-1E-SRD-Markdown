**Effect** This dungeon directs its malevolence toward everyone inside of it. Its interior is under the effects of [[guards-and-wards|guards and wards]] at all times. If this ability is dispelled, the haunt recreates it when it resets the following day. Once per minute, the dungeon can gather a collection of furniture and other items to form an [[animated-object|animated object]]. It can create one Colossal animated object; alternatively, it can create two Gargantuan animated objects, four Huge animated objects, and so on. It can control up to four times as many animated objects as it can create in a minute (for a total CR of 15). For the purposes of detecting creatures, the haunted dungeon and its animated objects have blindsight out to a range of the entire area of the haunt, even through walls.  ;
**Destruction** If the entire dungeon is simultaneously placed under the effects of [[hallow|hallow]], the haunt is destroyed.  

### Description

When enough haunts gather in a single dungeon, they can combine into a gestalt haunt that infuses the entire structure with a single, malevolent will. The haunt’s source typically rests in the most difficult to find or obscure location within the structure, but it moves if it senses creatures approaching it.
