### Description

A character suffering from melancholia struggles with severe pessimism and can often be slow to respond to threats and events going on around him. He can seem quiet and withdrawn, and his sense of enthusiasm is dulled. In extreme cases, a character suffering from melancholia becomes entirely introverted and utterly withdrawn, even to the point of near catatonia.
