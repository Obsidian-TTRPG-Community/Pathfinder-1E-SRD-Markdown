### Description

This peculiar nettle plant bears a singularly effective poison that protects it from being eaten: creatures pricked by the nettle’s thorns and affected by the poison are overcome with nausea at the mere idea of food, protecting the plant from being consumed. Farmers remain vigilant for signs of this fast-growing and hardy plant; it is difficult and dangerous to remove, so culling it is best done early, while the plant is still relatively small.
