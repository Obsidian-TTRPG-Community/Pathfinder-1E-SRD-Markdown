### Description

The wise alchemist takes careful precautions whenever handling hydrofluoric acid. This corrosive substance—an occasional byproduct of volcanic gases that is used for industrial purposes—dissolves bones and causes tissue damage when even a small amount contacts the skin. The acid dissolves the body of any victim who dies from hydrofluoric acid poisoning unless the acid is neutralized within 1 minute with a successful DC 20 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check. Hydrofluoric acid must be stored in a magically reinforced container, as it dissolves mundane glass and corrodes metal over time.
