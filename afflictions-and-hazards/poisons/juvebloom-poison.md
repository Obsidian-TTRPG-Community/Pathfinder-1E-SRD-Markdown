### Description

Swindlers claim this green capsule restores the victim’s youth. After 1 day, anyone taking juvebloom sees the seemingly time-bending results in the mirror. However, the benefit is not only temporary but also potentially quite damaging. Particularly daring confidence artists mix this capsule into a solution, attempting to sell it as the much more valuable sun orchid elixir.
