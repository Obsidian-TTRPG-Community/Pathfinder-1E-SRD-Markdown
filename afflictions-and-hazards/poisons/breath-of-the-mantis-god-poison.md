### Description

The Red Mantis exist in a world rife with healing magic and all manner of supernatural ways to dodge death. With the society’s reputation based on its ability to bring death to any contracted target, what good would it be if a kindly cleric or wealthy relative paid for a victim to be brought back to life? As a matter of professional pride (as well as religious fervor), the Red Mantis go to great lengths to ensure that their victims remain in the grave once they are placed there. Breath of the mantis god is just one tool they’ve crafted to assure such ends.  
  
This toxin is made only by Red Mantis assassins to ensure a target’s death, and the Red Mantis often task initiates with administering it to victims before their assassination. Once an affected creature fails its saving throw against this poison’s initial effect, if the creature dies before this poison is cured or runs its course, any spellcaster who attempts to raise the creature from the dead must first succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the dead creature’s total Hit Dice), otherwise the spell fails.
