### Description

Created by the Whispering Way to simultaneously protect and bind newcomers and servants who have handled dangerous writings, scholarblight has long since become a preferred poison for those who target arcane spellcasters for assassination. Scholarblight causes headaches and impairs a victim’s ability to form or recall memories through mild confusion and dysphoria. More drastically, victims who fail a saving throw against scholarblight lose their ability to read or write for 24 hours, as letters and symbols seem to twist, move, and reorient themselves. This prevents victims from using scrolls and spellbooks, but also protects an afflicted creature from any effect dependent on reading text, such as _explosive runes_.
