### Description

Refined from a traditional concoction first employed by the witches of Irrisen, mindrust—or “witch’s rust” as its northern creators know it—is a brownish, flaky concoction of condensed nightmare vapor, striped toadstools, and howler milk. The Order of the Rack has brought this poison south and uses it to get confessions from criminals, gain assistance in slipping into rebel holdouts, or make artists destroy their masterworks in a moment of weakness.  
  
Any creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw takes 1 point of Wisdom damage on each subsequent failed saving throw. For every point of Wisdom damage a sentient creature takes, it also become skittish and susceptible to suggestion for 1 minute. These minutes are cumulative; each time the creature takes Wisdom damage, its susceptibility to suggestion is extended by another minute. During that time, anyone can use the Intimidate skill as if it were the Diplomacy skill to make a request of the creature. Additionally, an affected creature takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against spells from the compulsion subschool while it is susceptible to suggestion. If this poison is neutralized, this susceptibility to suggestion also immediately ends.
