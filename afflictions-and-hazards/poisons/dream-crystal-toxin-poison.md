### Description

This supernatural toxin exists either in powdered form or, if mixed with an alchemically prepared solution of blood and magical reagents, as a sticky paste. The primary ingredient is a dream crystal whose stored dreams have been corrupted by otherworldly powers into nightmarish energies—a single crystal yields 1 dose of toxin. On Golarion, only the few dream crystals that remain in the crashed _Lirgen’s Glory_ can be used to create more of this toxin, but if the Emissary from Beyond establishes a domain in Dustpawn, it can create more dream crystals, given time. Dream crystal toxin introduced in significant quantities to a water supply dilutes the venom so that any who drink the water suffer a lesser version of its effects—see the curse of bestial dreams on page 4 for details. In any event, dream crystal toxin counts as both a poison and a curse for determining what can negate its effects. A creature must be immune to both poison and curses to be immune to dream crystal toxin.
