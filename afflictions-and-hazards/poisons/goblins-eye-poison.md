### Description

These bright red seeds feature a single black dot each, giving them a superficial resemblance to an eye. The bright colors of the seeds make them attractive to certain animals, as well as those unfamiliar with wilderness lore. A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check identifies the seed as poisonous. In some places, the seeds are used as jewelry.
