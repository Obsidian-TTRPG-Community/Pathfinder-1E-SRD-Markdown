### Description

This potent neurotoxin is created by the cloudthorn plant, a wild bramble whose thorns deliver a poison that numbs its victims to pain, allowing the plant to feast on the blood that flows from the wounds to the ground below. The plant’s name comes from the weightless, airy feeling that victims of the poison experience, which some liken to the notion of walking on clouds.
