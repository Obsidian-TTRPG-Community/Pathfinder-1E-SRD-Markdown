# [[PFS-Legal]] Confabulation powder

**Source** [_Alchemy Manual pg. 11_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy959n?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Alchemy-Manual)  
**Price** 80 gp; **Weight** —  
**Type** inhaled; **Save** Fortitude DC 18  
**Frequency** 1/minute for 2 minutes  
**Initial Effect** staggered for 1 minute; **Secondary Effect** If already staggered, stunned, or unconscious, the victim becomes highly suggestible. If an event (whether true or false) is described to him, he unconsciously fabricates a detailed memory of the event, filling in any gaps in the description with his own best guesses. The confabulated memory can be disbelieved with a successful DC 18 Will save the first time it is recalled, but if the save fails, the victim treats it as completely genuine thereafter. All confabulated memories can be removed with a _restoration_ or _heal_ spell  
**Cure** 1 save

### Alchemical Recipe
