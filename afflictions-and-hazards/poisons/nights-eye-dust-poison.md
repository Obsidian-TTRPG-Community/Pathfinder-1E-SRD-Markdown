### Description

This fine powder is extracted from the wings of night’s-eye moths. Creatures inhaling this poison become shaken and experience slowly building pressure behind the eyes, leading to blindness that persists until the creature is cured or the poison has run its course. A creature immune to fear cannot be shaken by the poison’s initial effect and receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw against the poison’s secondary effect.
