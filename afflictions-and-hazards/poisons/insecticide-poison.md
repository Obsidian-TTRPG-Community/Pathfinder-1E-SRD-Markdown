### Description

Farmers protecting their crops and landlords maintaining their properties use insecticide to clear out pest infestations, but they must avoid the fumes of this dangerous gas. While it is formulated to exterminate vermin, the poison poses a danger to anyone. A single dose of insecticide immediately fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. It can be thrown at a range of 20 feet, and it dissipates after 1d6 rounds in a well-ventilated area. A moderate wind disperses the gas in 1 round. Creatures with the vermin type take a –5 penalty on the save
