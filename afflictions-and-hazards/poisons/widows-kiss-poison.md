### Description

Developed by the spiderlike jorogumos (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3_ 156), widow’s kiss is distilled from the monsters’ natural venom and infused with minuscule spider eggs. Creatures injected with the toxin experience headaches and cold sweats, after which the eggs begin to hatch and infest the host’s bloodstream, slowly eating the body from within. If controlled or enticed, the swarm of spiders can take direct control of its host’s body, rendering hosts susceptible to effects that control or influence vermin, including a jorogumo’s spider empathy ability.  
  
The effects of widow’s kiss can be removed a combination of _cure disease_ and _neutralize poison_. If a creature is slain by the poison’s Constitution damage, a spider swarm (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 258) erupts from the body 1d6 rounds later.
