### Description

This milky-white sap can be harvested from a rare jungle tree known as a “weeping maiden” in the local tongue. The tree’s branches end in long, vine-like tendrils that hang low to the ground and bear large, bitter-tasting red fruit. While the fruit is safe to eat, the sap of the tree carries powerful neurotoxins that cause short-term memory loss in those that consume it. In some cultures, styx sap is occasionally taken deliberately in order to allow one to forget unpleasant or tragic events.
