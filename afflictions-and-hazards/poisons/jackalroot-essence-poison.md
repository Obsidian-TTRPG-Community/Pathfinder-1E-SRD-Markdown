### Description

The short and thorny jackalroot grows in desert climates, typically under the partial shade of ridges or boulders. It is identifiable by its pale green berries, which it bears twice per year. To followers of Lamashtu, the gnarled, prickle-covered jackalroot is a blessing. The roots of this hearty desert shrub contain a potent, incapacitating ichor often used by gnolls in religious ceremonies and when capturing slaves.
