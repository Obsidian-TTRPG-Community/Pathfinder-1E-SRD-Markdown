### Description

This yellow-brown mushroom is commonly found in deserts and other dry environments. Its spores absorb moisture at an incredible rate, wreaking havoc on the body of any creature foolish enough to consume it. Draughtcap fungus bears a close resemblance to a common edible mushroom, and a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check is required to differentiate the two.
