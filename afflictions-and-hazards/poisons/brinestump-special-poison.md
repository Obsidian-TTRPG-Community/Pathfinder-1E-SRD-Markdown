### Description

Invented as part of a series of dares between feuding goblin camps, this noxious brew fermented from a slurry of swamp flora is a favored concoction of the Licktoad tribe. The potent intoxicant is popular among goblinoids (who are immune to its nauseating effect), but all other races that partake of this frothy drink are wracked with nausea.
