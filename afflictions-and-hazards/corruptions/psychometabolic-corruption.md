# Psychometabolic Corruption

**Source** [_Psychic Anthology pg. 32_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qhr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Psychic-Anthology)  
Strange powers exist on Golarion and beyond. Those who survive a brush with cosmic phenomena, occult mysteries, or horrors from beyond the veil occasionally find psychic abilities awakening in their minds. Although potent, such power corrupts the body, subconscious mind, and emotions—often with disastrous results.  
  
The following corruption can be contracted by those who delve into occult lore better left forgotten.  

# Catalyst

A psychometabolic corruption is contracted as a result of experiencing extreme psychic trauma. When you contract this corruption, you gain a pool of psychometabolic power with a number of points equal to 1 + your manifestation level. These points are used to fuel the gifts of your manifestations. The pool replenishes at the start of each week or whenever you gain a new manifestation level.  

## Progression

The corruption is tied to your exposure to psychic power— the more you experience, the faster your progression advances. Whenever the total number of points in your psychometabolic pool reaches 0, you become afflicted with a random [[madnesses|madness]] from the following list within the next 24 hours: [[delirium-madness|delirium]], [[delusion-madness|delusion]], [[hallucination-madness|hallucination]], [[mania-madness|mania]], [[night-terrors-madness|night terrors]], [[paranoia-madness|paranoia]], or [[phobia-madness|phobia]]. This affliction lasts 8 hours, after which you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become twisted by your powers. You must also attempt this save when you are reduced to 10% or fewer of your maximum hit points by a psychic effect or when you fail a save against psychic effect by 5 or more. If you are unconscious or under the effects of [[calm-emotions|calm emotions]] for at least 6 of the hours that you spend afflicted with the madness, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of checks to prevent your corruption from progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.  
  
**Corruption Stage 1**: The first time you fail a Will save (as described above), your powers twist your mind. You are constantly afflicted with one madness of the GM's choice from among those listed above. This madness can't be cured or removed while you have this corruption.  
  
**Corruption Stage 2**: The second time you fail a Will save (as described above), your powers erode your values and morals and replace them with megalomaniacal thoughts. You gain the [[moral-insanity-madness|moral insanity]] madness. This madness can't be cured or removed while you have this corruption.  
  
**Corruption Stage 3**: The third time you fail a Will save (as described above), your body is twisted into a writhing mass of flesh that imprisons your mind. You become a [[hungry-flesh|hungry flesh]] under the GM's control, retaining all class levels and abilities that do not rely upon your original form.  

## Removing the Corruption

To remove the psychometabolic corruption, a psychic spellcaster whose caster level is at least double your manifestation level must eliminate your memories of gaining the corruption and your corruption stage advancing, such as by [[modify-memory|modify memory]], and then must cast [[psychic-surgery|psychic surgery]] on you.  

# Manifestations

The following are manifestations of the psychometabolic corruption.  

## Ameliorate Damage

**Source** [_Psychic Anthology pg. 31_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qhr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Psychic-Anthology)  
You can repair damage to your body.  
**Gift**: You can use any of the following spells as a spell-like ability by spending a number of points from your psychometabolic pool equal to the spell’s cleric spell level: [[restoration-lesser|lesser restoration]], [[regenerate|regenerate]], [[restoration|restoration]], or any _cure_ spell (a spell with the word “cure” in its name). You can target only yourself with these spells, and you can use this manifestation to cast only a spell whose spell level on the cleric spell list is equal to or less than your manifestation level. You are always treated as a living creature for the purpose of these spells’ effects.  
**Stain**: Your body becomes twisted and alien. When an effect other than this manifestation’s spell-like abilities heals your ability damage or hit point damage, roll the amount of healing twice and use the lower result.  

## Defy Gravity

You can rend your foes’ minds with psychic power.  
**Prerequisite**: Endless echoes, psychometabolic blast.  
**Gift**: When you use the telekinetic blast gained from the psychometabolic blast manifestation, you can spend 2 points of psychometabolic power to use the telekinetic force to wreck the mind of each creature targeted. Instead of you rolling to hit targets with your blast, each target can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your manifestation level + your Constitution modifier) to try to negate the damage and any infusions or metakinesis abilities applied to it. When using this ability, your telekinetic blast is a mind-affecting effect.  
**Stain**: Using your powers causes blood to ooze from your nose and eyes. Whenever you spend a psychometabolic point, you take nonlethal damage equal to your manifestation level per point spent.  

## Psychometabolic Blast

You can attack your enemies with your mind.  
**Gift**: You gain the [[kineticist|kineticist’s kinetic blast]] class feature, as well as the [[telekinetic-blast|telekinetic blast]] wild talent. Use your manifestation level as your effective kineticist level to determine the effects of these abilities. If you have the elemental focus (aether) or expanded element (aether) class ability, you instead gain a bonus on damage rolls with your telekinetic blast equal to half your manifestation level (minimum +1).  
**Stain**: Your cranium swells massively. You take a –2 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based checks and skill checks.

Use your kineticist level or your manifestation level (whichever is higher) as your effective kineticist level to determine the effects of these abilities. You can spend 1 point of psychometabolic power to enhance your force ward as if you had accepted a point of burn. If you already have the force ward defense wild talent, this gift has no effect.  
**Stain**: You reflexes become sluggish. You take a –1 penalty on your AC and on Reflex saving throws.
