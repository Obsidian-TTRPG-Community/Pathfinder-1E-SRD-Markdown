**Type** ingested; **Addiction** major, Fortitude DC 26  
**Price** 100 gp  
**Effect** a user under the effect of a [[suggestion|suggestion]] spell can attempt another saving throw (with the effect's original DC) to shake off the spell's effect, but he loses all memories from the previous 1d4 hours, as per modify memory but without the 5-minute limit  
**Damage** 1d4 damage to a random ability score  
A less pure version of refined cytillesh, oblivion retains the unpredictable side effects and highly addictive properties of the source material. Oblivion is common in Cassomir's slums and the Puddles district of Absalom. Type ingested; Addiction major, Fortitude DC 26
