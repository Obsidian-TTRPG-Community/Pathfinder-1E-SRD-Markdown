# Haunting, Major

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 138_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**Type** curse; **Save** Will DC 17  
**Effect** The victim is haunted by a [[ghost|ghost]] as described in [[haunting-minor-curse|minor haunting]].  
**Cure** Unlike a minor haunting, a major haunting can be ended only by putting the ghost to rest, though casting [[remove-curse|remove curse]] directly after the ghost is destroyed prevents it from reviving for 2d4 days.
