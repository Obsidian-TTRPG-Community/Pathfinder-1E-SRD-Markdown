# Weeping Wound

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 140_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**Type** curse; **Save** Fortitude DC 14  
**Effect** The victim has a wound that cannot heal, effectively reducing her maximum hit points by an amount equal to her level or 5, whichever is more. Magical healing that would raise a victim’s hit points above this reduced maximum is wasted.
