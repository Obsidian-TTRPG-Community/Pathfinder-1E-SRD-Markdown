# Jealous Structure

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 144_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**Type** regional curse; **Save** Will DC 19  
**Effect** A building can take on a life of its own if enough memories, fears, or other strong emotions become bound up in it. Such a building seeks to force residents to stay and either keep it company, serve it, protect it, or feed its unearthly hungers. The jealous structure is similar to a building-sized intelligent magic item of any evil alignment with Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 16, fast healing 5, and the ability to use the following spell-like abilities at caster level 11th a minimum of the number of times per day listed below: 3/day—[[animate-objects|animate objects]] (furniture only), [[fear|heightened _fear_ (DC 19)]], [[telekinesis|heightened _telekinesis_]] (unattended objects only; DC 19); 1/day—[[guards-and-wards|guards and wards]].  
**Cure** A jealous structure can be put to rest only by a casting of [[remove-curse|remove curse]] followed by a casting of [[hallow|hallow]] over the entire structure.
