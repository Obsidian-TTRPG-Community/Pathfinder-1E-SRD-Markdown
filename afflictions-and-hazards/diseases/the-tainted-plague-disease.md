**Source** [_Pathfinder Campaign Setting pg. 149_](http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/35E/v5748btpy84eo)  
**Type** contact; **Fortitude Save** DC 15 (see description)  
**Onset** 1 day; **Frequency** 1/day  
**Effect** 1d6 Con and 1d6 Wis  
**Cure** 2 consecutive saves  
Even in the absence of ravening abyssal hordes, the Worldwound causes a supernatural disease called the tainted plague. Those exposed to the Worldwound or creatures native to it (including creatures already suffering ability damage from the disease) must make a DC 15 Fortitude save once per day or become infected. Those reduced to 0 Wisdom are driven mad by the mind-bending horrors they have witnessed. Those reduced to 0 Constitution perish, their bodies rotting from the inside out and dissolving within 24 hours into primordial chaos matter.  
  
Creatures that do not need to breathe gain a +2 bonus on saves made to resist the tainted plague, but any creature eating or drinking anything from within the Worldwound must save immediately at a suffers a –5 penalty unless _purify food and drink_ is first used.
